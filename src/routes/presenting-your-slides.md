# Good presentation skills
- Communication, whether verbal or written, is about getting the idea from your mind into someone else's mind.
    - You do that by making it easy for them to understand.
- Slides
    - One idea per slide.
    - But don't be too afraid of text-heavy slides. They are frequently shared before or after the meeting.
- Speaking
    - Say one thing. 
    - Try not to speak continuously for more than a minute at a time.
    - Your first words should be the memorable point you are trying to make. Most people start a stream of words.
    - Read out the headline word for word. That's the one thing you need to get into their head. After that you know you're safe.
    - Pause after you've said the thing.

###Â Notes
- Start with a top down view. It gives people a mental map of where you're going.
    - You want to get to the point straight. You want to avoid people sidetracking you. So give them the map and your key point straight away. Otherwise you'll spend 60% of the time on the intro.

### Ozge's notes
Not organized properly but this is what I noted:
What's the purpose of verbal communication / presentation ? - we want to bring the audience's mind to the same place of our mind
start with a clear explanation of what's the take away of the presentation
Have clear titles for each slide
have one idea per slide
lock down the key words - jargon in the presentation slides
Develop catch phrases to improve the transition between slides
very deliberate sign posting
verbal communication - make it clear with your voice that you're done with one idea
pause in between each idea and check if all is clear
When you receive questions/comments instead of phrasing that you had the same thing in mind, instead make your point if the question/comment relates to another problem
