# Good presentation skills
- Communication, whether verbal or written, is about getting the idea from your mind into someone else's mind.
    - You do that by making it easy for them to understand.
- Slides
    - One idea per slide.
    - But don't be too afraid of text-heavy slides. They are frequently shared before or after the meeting.
- Speaking
    - Say one thing. 
    - Try not to speak continuously for more than a minute at a time.
    - Your first words should be the memorable point you are trying to make. Most people start a stream of words.
    - Read out the headline word for word. That's the one thing you need to get into their head. After that you know you're safe.
    - Pause after you've said the thing.
