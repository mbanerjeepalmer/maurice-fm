# Hacketisms

[Catechisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism) for a hackathon. Repeat after me:
1. THE DEMO IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
2. TOOL PERFORMANCE IS GOVERNED BY FAMILIARITY NOT FEATURES
3. TEAM COHERENCE OVER CAPABILITIES

## THE DEMO IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS
Start with the demo and work backwards. Identify what the one 'wow' moment is. Orient absolutely everything around that one 'wow' moment.

Every hour, the demo should have improved.

What counts as improving the demo?
- Spent the first hour sketching your understanding of what problem you're solving, the user journey and technical implementation to solve it? Yes, just. It'll be an embarrassing demo, but at least it's _a demo_. 
- Spent the hour setting up the database and its schema? No, doesn't count. When someone walks over to your table to 'See how it's going' you aren't going to show them the DB schema, are you? You'll show them your plans. So the demo hasn't improved.
- Spent an hour hardcoding a user journey? Yes, that counts.
- Spent an hour wiring up the database to the previous-harcoded frontend, so that the demo actually delivers the wow moment with real data? Yes that's the end goal.

So I'm not saying I won't do databases in hackathons. But I'll be muttering '_THE DEMO IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS, THE DEMO IS THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS_' under my breath for the whole half hour that it's being set up.

## TOOL PERFORMANCE IS GOVERNED BY FAMILIARITY NOT FEATURES

Code Deployer 3000™ is newer and far more reliable than DeployCode Millennium Edition™. But you're only really familiar with DeployCode™.

Use the familiar software, because even it has few features and many defects, at least they're feature gaps and defects that you can understand. The [boring technology club](https://boringtechnology.club/) exists because [reality contains a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail), [software especially so](https://x.com/rkoutnik/status/1085633512839888896).

Spend 30mins reading the docs for Code Deployer 3000™? Well, it better make you 30mins faster at deploying _the actual demoable project_ and not spring some unexpected incompatibility on you two hours before submission.

(Side note: hackathons are great opportunities to learn new tools. But remember that you probably can't demo your new-found familiarity with Code Deployer 3000™.)

## TEAM COHERENCE OVER CAPABILITIES

A surprising number of good submissions come from teams from only one person, often not even that highly-skilled.

Good project management gets around this. The left hand is doing the backend, the right hand is doing the frontend. They both stitch together in time and it's happy families.

But remember, if they don't stitch together _then you can only demo half of it_. So one designer who just puts together a coherent Figma prototype is _much better_ than half a Figma prototype and half a web app.

## Context
- I did the [a16z/Mistral](https://a16zcrypto.com/posts/article/hack-uk-london-hackathon/) hackathon in London. It didn't go well. My team didn't even complete the [submission](https://hackukmistral.devpost.com/project-gallery) step in time.
- Why? I'd had [modest](https://amplitude.com/community/events/hackathon-2022-london) successes in past hackathons, helped with [The Hackathon Survival guide](https://www.hackathonsurvivalguide.com/) and I've [run a couple](https://hackthepress.org/) too. So I can tell you what good looks like.
- But I probably didn't say it enough. During the Mistral hack I could sense some things weren't working. But I let them slide.
- So, here we are: hacketisms. The [catechisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catechism) for a hackathon. Things to say again and again, to avoid another fall from grace.
- Regular readers might ask, 'But Maurice, I thought you were focused on Banquet? What's with all these hackathons?' I'm using them as time-boxed ways to explore the [Idea Maze](https://spark-public.s3.amazonaws.com/startup/lecture_slides/lecture5-market-wireframing-design.pdf).
