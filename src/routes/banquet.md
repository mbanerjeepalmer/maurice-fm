# Banquet

<!-- # A feast for your ears and eyeballs

The last time you scrolled through your phone, did it feel like the best use of your time?

Didn't think so. That's why I'm starting Banquet.

## The best use of your time

I'm going to give you the best possible selection of media for you.

Maybe you need a couple of headlines, selection of Tweets from people you follow, some articles from the industry you work in, a YouTube video about your new hobby and a piece of local news. Maybe on weekends you want to replace the work-related articles with a long read. Maybe at 4pm on Tuesday you want your day lightening with a cat video. It's whatever is best for you.

## Get early access, stop doomscrolling

I'm granting access in very small groups so that I can ensure the best possible experience. Once your cohort opens I'll spend 30 minutes with you to understand what you need.

Then you'll get a notification every day that your Banquet is ready.

Even better, at the end of the month you'll receive a physical copy of your whole month of Banquets.

My first (very small) cohort of users is already full. To join the next group to get access and stop doomscrolling leave your details below. -->
