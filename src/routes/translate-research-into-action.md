# How do I translate my research into action?

### Make it easy, avoid mystique
Presenting the research is important. It should be designed to be understood and then acted on. People often do the opposite.
- Too often research is presented in a dense way. Multiple pages of long paragraphs, long sentences and jargon. It dwells on the methodology.
- This creates a type of mystique about 'the research'. I hear people say 'I need to block out some time to read "the research" this afternoon. 
- It gives the impression that the reader should be pleased with themselves for just having read it. It means "the research" sits unread but gives the researcher a feeling of intellectual superiority.
- But you're not Wittgenstein writing 'The Critique of Pure Reason'. So don't be afraid of putting together the BuzzFeed version of it.

## Package up your research
Once you've done your research, you actually have to use it.
- Instead, of an academic paper, package your research it as if it was news.
- Make sure there is a clear headline from the research as well as a few key takeaways.
- Pull out key quotes and evidence. You can paste them into slide decks in large font sizes to make a case for your product change.

### Make your findings like tweets
Make your research easy to consume and memorable.
- Have a compelling overall headline.
- Keep the list of findings short, jargon-free and easy to remember. 
- Make the heading and key findings interesting and actionable.
- You want people to be able to reel them off in meetings: "From our research we learnt that we have four key problems with click and collect. And we need more resources to solve problem two"
- You don't want people to see 'Information scent analysis of click and collect' followed by 15 paragraphs.

### Sell your research
Selling your research is important because you want other people to be bought in to your findings.
A natural way to do this is with a slide deck. As an example:
- Start with a summary slide. Put the overall finding as the heading and the key findings in a brief bullet pointed list below. You want to give people the answers up front, you're not writing a detective novel.
- After the summary, take people though the evidence. Remember you're telling a story about users and their problems. Your process is important to you, but not to your users or your stakeholders.
- Make the document easy to read, easy to share and easy to find. You might like your text-heavy, jargon-laden board on Figma, but no one else will understand it.
- Surprising and important quotes can be pulled out. You want to make an impression with other people.
- Make original materials (recordings, notes, etc.) easy to access. That way, people can dig into useful or controversial findings.

### Why do you need to package research in this way?
Structure your findings to be widely understood and then acted on. Make it easy to:
- Build the case for the problems you discover: In larger organisations you should treat packaging up as equally important as the actual learning. 
- Guide your your team's work: It's easier know which work will be valuable to users when you have a list of five pain points instead of 10 pages of notes.
